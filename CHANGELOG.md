# Changelog

## Unreleased

## [0.0.2] - 2023-03-10 

Updated workflow, to include phpcs when using dev-dependencies, so github now
runs a series of checks, including linting and disallows TODO/tbd into a complete integration-suite.

## [0.0.1] - 2023-03-10

* Mention whether you follow Semantic Versioning.
